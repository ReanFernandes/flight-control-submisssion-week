<h2> Flight Control: Comparison of Numerical Methods for Nonlinear MPC of Crazyflie 2.1 Nanocopter </h2>[main.pdf](https://github.com/ReanFernandes/flight-control-submisssion-week/files/11223546/main.pdf)


This repository contains the code and results for a lab project offered by the Systems and Control Optimization Lab (SYSCOP) at the University of Freiburg. The project aims to compare two numerical methods, Direct Multiple Shooting and Direct Collocation, for implementing Nonlinear Model Predictive Control (MPC) in a real-time setting for the Crazyflie 2.1 nanocopter.

Nonlinear MPC was implemented using both methods to compare their performance, and CasADi was used to construct the Nonlinear Programs with IPOPT as the numerical solver.

The repository includes the code for both methods and the results obtained from the experiments conducted. Please refer to the documentation included in the repository for more details about the project and the code.
